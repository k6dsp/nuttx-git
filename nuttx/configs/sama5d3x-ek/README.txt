Development Environment
=======================

  Several possibile development enviorments may be use:

  - Linux or OSX native
  - Cygwin unders Windows
  - MinGW + MSYS under Windows
  - Windows native (with GNUMake from GNUWin32).

  All testing has been performed using Cygwin under Windows.

  The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
  toolchains will likely cause problems.

GNU Toolchain Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The NuttX make system has been modified to support the several different
  toolchain options.

  All testing has been conducted using the AtmelStudio GCC toolchain.  To use
  the CodeSourcery, devkitARM or Raisonance GNU toolchain, you simply need to
  add one of the following configuration options to your .config (or defconfig)
  file:

    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYW=y  : CodeSourcery under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_CODESOURCERYL=y  : CodeSourcery under Linux
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_ATOLLIC=y        : Atollic toolchain for Windos
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_DEVKITARM=y      : devkitARM under Windows
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y      : NuttX buildroot under Linux or Cygwin (default)
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIL=y      : Generic GCC ARM EABI toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y      : Generic GCC ARM EABI toolchain for Windows

  The AtmelStudio GCC toolchain is selected with CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y
  and setting the PATH variable appropriately.

  If you are not using AtmelStudio GCC toolchain, then you may also have to
  modify the PATH in the setenv.h file if your make cannot find the tools.

  NOTE about Windows native toolchains
  ------------------------------------

  There are several limitations to using a Windows based toolchain in a
  Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath'
     utility but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check
     out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic
     links are used in Nuttx (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works
     around these problems for the Windows tools by copying directories
     instead of linking them.  But this can also cause some confusion for
     you:  For example, you may edit a file in a "linked" directory and find
     that your changes had no effect.  That is because you are building the
     copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic directory.  If you use a\
     Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of making like this:

       make clean_context all

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

  3. Dependencies are not made when using Windows versions of the GCC.  This is
     because the dependencies are generated using Windows pathes which do not
     work with the Cygwin make.

       MKDEP                = $(TOPDIR)/tools/mknulldeps.sh

  NOTE 1: Older CodeSourcery toolchains (2009q1) do not work with default
  optimization level of -Os (See Make.defs).  It will work with -O0, -O1, or
  -O2, but not with -Os.

  NOTE 2: The devkitARM toolchain includes a version of MSYS make.  Make sure that
  the paths to Cygwin's /bin and /usr/bin directories appear BEFORE the devkitARM
  path or will get the wrong version of make.

IDEs
^^^^

  NuttX is built using command-line make.  It can be used with an IDE, but some
  effort will be required to create the project (There is a simple RIDE project
  in the RIDE subdirectory).

  Makefile Build
  --------------
  Under Eclipse, it is pretty easy to set up an "empty makefile project" and
  simply use the NuttX makefile to build the system.  That is almost for free
  under Linux.  Under Windows, you will need to set up the "Cygwin GCC" empty
  makefile project in order to work with Windows (Google for "Eclipse Cygwin" -
  there is a lot of help on the internet).

  Native Build
  ------------
  Here are a few tips before you start that effort:

  1) Select the toolchain that you will be using in your .config file
  2) Start the NuttX build at least one time from the Cygwin command line
     before trying to create your project.  This is necessary to create
     certain auto-generated files and directories that will be needed.
  3) Set up include pathes:  You will need include/, arch/arm/src/sam34,
     arch/arm/src/common, arch/arm/src/armv7-m, and sched/.
  4) All assembly files need to have the definition option -D __ASSEMBLY__
     on the command line.

  Startup files will probably cause you some headaches.  The NuttX startup file
  is arch/arm/src/sam34/sam_vectors.S.  You may need to build NuttX
  one time from the Cygwin command line in order to obtain the pre-built
  startup object needed by RIDE.

NuttX EABI "buildroot" Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  A GNU GCC-based toolchain is assumed.  The files */setenv.sh should
  be modified to point to the correct path to the Cortex-M3 GCC toolchain (if
  different from the default in your PATH variable).

  If you have no Cortex-M3 toolchain, one can be downloaded from the NuttX
  SourceForge download site (https://sourceforge.net/projects/nuttx/files/buildroot/).
  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh sama5d3x-ek/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3 .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly built binaries.

  See the file configs/README.txt in the buildroot source tree.  That has more
  details PLUS some special instructions that you will need to follow if you are
  building a Cortex-M3 toolchain for Cygwin under Windows.

  NOTE:  Unfortunately, the 4.6.3 EABI toolchain is not compatible with the
  the NXFLAT tools.  See the top-level TODO file (under "Binary loaders") for
  more information about this problem. If you plan to use NXFLAT, please do not
  use the GCC 4.6.3 EABI toochain; instead use the GCC 4.3.3 OABI toolchain.
  See instructions below.

NuttX OABI "buildroot" Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The older, OABI buildroot toolchain is also available.  To use the OABI
  toolchain, use the build instructtions above, but (1) modify the
  cortexm3-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3 configuration to use OABI (using 'make
  menuconfig'), or (2) use an exising OABI configuration such as
  cortexm3-defconfig-4.3.3

NXFLAT Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If you are *not* using the NuttX buildroot toolchain and you want to use
  the NXFLAT tools, then you will still have to build a portion of the buildroot
  tools -- just the NXFLAT tools.  The buildroot with the NXFLAT tools can
  be downloaded from the NuttX SourceForge download site
  (https://sourceforge.net/projects/nuttx/files/).

  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh sama5d3x-ek/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-defconfig-nxflat .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly built NXFLAT binaries.

    CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE=0x0002000 (128Kb)

  CONFIG_DRAM_START - The physical start address of installed DRAM

    CONFIG_DRAM_START=0x20000000

  CONFIG_DRAM_VSTART - The virutal start address of installed DRAM

    CONFIG_DRAM_VSTART=0x20000000

  CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO - The SAM3UF103Z supports interrupt prioritization

    CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO=y

  CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS - Use LEDs to show state. Unique to boards that
  have LEDs

  CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
  stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt

Configurations
==============

  Information Common to All Configurations
  ----------------------------------------
  Each SAM3U-EK configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
  can be selected as follow:

    cd tools
    ./configure.sh sama5d3x-ek/<subdir>
    cd -
    . ./setenv.sh

  Before sourcing the setenv.sh file above, you should examine it and perform
  edits as necessary so that BUILDROOT_BIN is the correct path to the directory
  than holds your toolchain binaries.

  And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
  the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply, nuttx.

    make

  The <subdir> that is provided above as an argument to the tools/configure.sh
  must be is one of the following.

  NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       and misc/tools/

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output on UART0 (J3).

  3. Unless otherwise stated, the configurations are setup for
     Linux (or any other POSIX environment like Cygwin under Windows):

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y   : Linux or other POSIX environment

  4. All of these configurations use the Code Sourcery for Windows toolchain
     (unless stated otherwise in the description of the configuration).  That
     toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using 'make menuconfig'.
     Here are the relevant current settings:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOS=y                : Microsoft Windows
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Using Cygwin or other POSIX environment

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : GNU EABI toolchain for windows

     That same configuration will work with Atmel GCC toolchain.  The only
     change required to use the Atmel GCC toolchain is to change the PATH
     variable so that those tools are selected instead of the CodeSourcery
     tools.  Try 'which arm-none-eabi-gcc' to make sure that you are
     selecting the right tool.

     The setenv.sh file is available for you to use to set the PATH
     variable.  The path in the that file may not, however, be correct
     for your installation.

     See also the "NOTE about Windows native toolchains" in the section call
     "GNU Toolchain Options" above.
